## About the plugin

This plugin extends the WPGraphQL & WP-Polls plugins and provide the interface for consuming the WP-Polls through queries and mutations.

## Examples

### Querying

You can query polls by doing the following query:

```graphql
query GetAllPolls {
  polls {
    id
    question
    totalVotes
    open
    maxAnswers
    voted
    answers {
      id
      description
      votes
    }
  }
}

If you need to query an specific poll you can do it by passing the poll `id` through the query, like the example bellow:

```graphql
query GetPollById {
  polls(id: 1) {
    ...
  }
}
```

## Voting

You can vote in an existing poll like so:

```graphql
mutation PollVote {
  vote(input: {
    clientMutationId: "Vote",
    id: 1,
    userId: 1,
    answers: "1,2,3"
  }) {
    status
    message
  }
}
```
